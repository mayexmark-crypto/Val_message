    <p>I know you felt like I was so relaxed and calm about Valentine's Day, acted like it's just another date on the calendar, but I very well know it ain't. Reason being you're not ordinary to me, and what we have is not ordinary either.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I sit quietly and replay the moments we've had together, the way it felt to finally see you in person (of course you wanted it to happen sooner, but I guess everything happened just at the right time), the way time moved too fast, the way your presence made the world feel softer. I still remember how I looked at you and realized, oh… this is real, not an idea, not a fantasy, not a maybe. You were there, in front of me. I felt something settle inside me that I can't explain without sounding dramatic; it was like my heart finally recognized its own language.</p>
    <p>And now that we're apart again, I feel it even more because distance does a strange thing. It makes love louder, small memories heavier. It turns the simplest things into cravings—your voice, your laugh, your face close to mine, the warmth of you when you're relaxed and not pretending to be tough. I miss you in ways I didn't expect. Not just emotionally, but physically too.</p>
    <p>I'm not writing this to be perfect. I'm writing because I don't want you to ever wonder where you stand with me. I admire you, your softness, your confidence, the way you carry yourself, the way you're both sweet and bougie in the best way. I love the way you're you, the kind of woman who can be gentle without being weak, and beautiful without trying too hard. And I want you to know something; I don't take you lightly.</p>
    <p>I know we met late last year and we've only had a few chances to be together in person. But those moments weren't small to me. They were enough to show me what this could be, what it already is. And yes, I miss you, I want you, I want more time, more days, more nights, more moments where I don't have to count down the hours until I have to let you go again.</p>
    <p>But since I can't do that right now, I'll do the next best thing; showing up for you. I'll keep being consistent and honest. I'll keep loving you in the ways I can, until I get to love you in the ways I want.</p>
    <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love. ❤️</p>
