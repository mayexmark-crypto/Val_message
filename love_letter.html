    <h1>Hi baby,</h1>

    <p>
      I am happy to pen down this letter to you. Thanks for being patient and waiting for this special day to open this up. I'm really happy to celebrate my first Valentine's with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every day with you has felt like a gentle reminder that love can be soft, safe, and incredibly beautiful. You make the smallest moments feel special, whether it is a random chat, a shared laugh, or those quiet pauses where we just exist together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love the way you care, the way you listen, and the way you somehow know how to make my heart feel understood. You have this calm, warm presence that makes everything feel a little less heavy and a lot more hopeful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for choosing me, for staying, and for letting me be a part of your world. Thank you for your kindness, your patience, and your love, even on days when I don't make it easy. You are more than I ever knew to pray for, and I'm grateful for you—deeply, quietly, and completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can't wait to make more memories with you, to grow with you, and to keep learning all the little things that make you, you. This is our first Valentine's together, and I pray it's the first of many, many more.
    </p>

      With all my love,<br>
      Your baby ❤️
